# Create React App â€” Getting Started Guide

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a comfortable environment for building React applications without configuration.

---

## Available Commands

You can run the following scripts from the project root directory:

### npm start

Starts the development server.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to preview the app.

The app reloads automatically when source files are modified.  
Any linting errors will appear in the console.

### npm test

Runs the test suite in watch mode, enabling you to see results immediately as you code.  
For more details, visit the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### npm run build

Generates an optimized, production-ready build in the build folder.  
The output is minified and hashed for caching efficiency.

Refer to the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) to learn how to deploy your app.

### npm run eject

> *Warning:* This action is irreversible.

This command exposes the underlying configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) allowing full customization of the build setup. Use only if you need advanced control over the build process.
